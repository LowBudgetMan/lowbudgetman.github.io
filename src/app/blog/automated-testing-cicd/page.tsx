                        Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) have become standard practices in modern 
                        software development. At the heart of effective CI/CD pipelines lies automated testing, which ensures 
                        that code changes don&apos;t introduce regressions or new bugs.
                    </p>

                        <li>End-to-end tests for complete user flows</li>
                        <li>Performance tests for system efficiency</li>

                    <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                        Investing in automated testing pays dividends through increased confidence in deployments, 
                        faster release cycles, and improved code quality. It&apos;s not just about catching bugs—it&apos;s about
                        enabling your team to move faster with greater confidence.

                    <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                        CI/CD pipelines automate the process of integrating code changes, building applications, running tests, 
                        and deploying to production. Automated testing is the quality gate that ensures only reliable code 
                        progresses through this pipeline.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                        Without robust automated testing, CI/CD pipelines can actually accelerate the introduction of bugs 
                        into production. With proper testing, they become powerful tools for maintaining and improving 
                        software quality while increasing development velocity.

                    <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                        A well-designed testing strategy includes multiple layers of tests, each serving a specific purpose 
                        in your quality assurance process:

                    <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                        Unit tests verify that individual components (functions, classes, modules) work correctly in isolation. 
                        They are:
                    </p>

                        <li><strong>Isolated:</strong> Don&apos;t depend on external systems or state</li>
                        <li><strong>Numerous:</strong> Often comprise 70-80% of your test suite</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                        Unit tests provide immediate feedback to developers and catch issues at the component level before 
                        they propagate to more complex interactions.
                    </p>

                    <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                        Integration tests catch issues that unit tests might miss, particularly around component interactions 
                        and external dependencies.

                    <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                        End-to-end (E2E) tests verify that entire user flows work correctly from start to finish. They:

                        <li><strong>Test across systems:</strong> Verify functionality across all components and services</li>
                        <li><strong>Validate business requirements:</strong> Ensure the application meets business needs</li>

                    <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                        While E2E tests are slower and more brittle than other test types, they provide crucial validation

                    <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                        Performance tests help identify bottlenecks, resource limitations, and scaling issues before they

                        With comprehensive test coverage, teams can deploy changes with greater confidence, knowing that 
                        critical functionality has been verified. This confidence enables more frequent releases and reduces 
                        the stress associated with deployments.

                    <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                        The discipline of writing testable code often leads to better architecture and design. Code that&apos;s
                        easy to test tends to be more modular, have clearer interfaces, and follow better separation of concerns.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Prioritize test coverage strategically:</strong> Focus on critical paths and high-risk areas first. 
                            Aim for high coverage of core business logic and less coverage of simple, low-risk code.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Optimize test execution time:</strong> Fast feedback is crucial in CI/CD. Structure your pipeline 
                            to run fast tests first and parallelize test execution where possible.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Maintain test quality:</strong> Flaky or unreliable tests undermine confidence in your test suite. 
                            Regularly review and refactor tests to ensure they remain valuable and trustworthy.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Integrate testing throughout the pipeline:</strong> Different test types should run at appropriate 
                            stages. For example, unit tests might run on every commit, while more extensive E2E tests might run before deployment.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Make test results visible and actionable:</strong> Ensure test failures provide clear information 
                            about what failed and why, making it easier for developers to address issues quickly.
